## Tidying the dad_mom file

```{r dad_mom}

library("magrittr") #for piping
library("tidyverse")

dad_mom <- read.table("dad_mom.txt", header = TRUE)

#separate values for dads and moms into their own dataframes
dad <- dad_mom %>%
  select(fam_id, "name" = name_dad, "income" = income_dad)
mom <- dad_mom %>%
  select(fam_id, "name" = name_mom, "income" = income_dad)

joined_parents <- dad %>%
  bind_rows(c(dad, mom), .id = "parent") #recombine vertically, set id to differentiate

#from here, I can't figure out how to change the '1' to 'dad' and '2' to 'mom'

## Joining together CTRP data

```{r CTRP data}

#import all data files
AUC_1 <- read.csv("CTRP_files/AUC_1.csv")
AUC_2 <- read.csv("CTRP_files/AUC_2.csv")
line_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/cancer_cell_line_info.csv")
compound_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/compound_info.csv")
experiment_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/Experiment_info.csv")

#combine files
joined_CTRP <- AUC_1 %>%
  full_join(AUC_2, by = c("experiment_id", "area_under_curve", "master_cpd_id")) %>% #add AUC files
  full_join(compound_info, by = "master_cpd_id") %>% #add compound_info
  full_join(experiment_info, by = c("experiment_id" = "expt_id")) %>% #add experiment_info
  full_join(line_info, by = "master_ccl_id") #add line_info

glimpse(joined_CTRP)
