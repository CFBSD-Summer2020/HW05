## Part 1: Tidying up the dad_mom file

```{r show P1 data, echo = FALSE}
dad_mom <- read.delim("dad_mom.txt", header = TRUE)
kable(dad_mom, format = "markdown")
### Just taking a look at what we're working with
```

```{r tidying, echo = FALSE}
tidy_dad_mom <- dad_mom %>%
  unite(dad, name_dad, income_dad) %>%
  unite(mom, name_mom, income_mom) %>%
### Put together all the mom data under 'mom' and dad data under 'dad', now to put it together into a chart
  gather(key = "Parent", value = "value", mom, dad) %>%
  separate("value", into = c("Name", "Income"))
### Print out the results
kable(tidy_dad_mom, format = "markdown")
```

## Part 2: Joining together CTRP data

```{r show P2 data, echo = FALSE}
AUC_1 <- read.csv("CTRP_files/AUC_1.csv")
AUC_2 <- read.csv("CTRP_files/AUC_2.csv")
ccell_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/cancer_cell_line_info.csv")
cmpd_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/compound_info.csv")
expt_info <- read.csv("CTRP_files/Experiment_info.csv")
```

```{r join, echo = FALSE}
CTRP_total <- AUC_1 %>%
  bind_rows(AUC_2) %>%
  inner_join(expt_info, by = c("experiment_id" = "expt_id")) %>%
  inner_join(ccell_info, by = "master_ccl_id") %>%
  inner_join(cmpd_info, by = "master_cpd_id") 

### print(CTRP_total)
### Nevermind, don't print this out, the document is far too long
```

## Part 2 Q1: Which cancer type has the lowest AUC values to the compound "vorinostat"?

```{r Q1: Which cancer type has the lowest AUC values to the compound "vorinostat"?, echo = TRUE}
vorinostat_lowest <- CTRP_total %>%
  filter(cpd_name == "vorinostat") %>%
  arrange(area_under_curve)

vorinostat_lowest %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(area_under_curve, cancer_type) +
  labs(title = "Vorinostat area under curve by cancer type", x = "Area under curve", y = "Cancer type") +
  geom_boxplot()

### print(vorinostat_lowest)
### Seems like I can't get my boxplot to show up, not sure why. I manually printed out the data using print(vorinostat_lowest) and found that the lowest AUC values are predominantly "Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues"
```

## Part 2 Q2: Which compound is the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 most sensitive to?

```{r Q2: Which compound is the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 most sensitive to?, echo = TRUE}
cell_sensitive <- CTRP_total %>%
  filter(ccl_name == "22RV1") %>%
  arrange(area_under_curve)

cell_sensitive %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(area_under_curve, cpd_name) +
  labs(title = "22Rv1 sensitive compounds", x = "Area under curve", y = "Compound name") +
  geom_boxplot()

### print(cell_sensitive) 
### Getting an error code I copy/pasted below. In the meantime, continuing my brute-force method, I manually printed out the data and found that the highest sensitivity was to Leptomycin B
#### Error code: File README_files/figure-gfm/Q2: Which compound is the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 most sensitive to not found in resource path
#### Error: pandoc document conversion failed with error 99
#### Execution halted
#### Not sure how to get past this problem, I'll look at it more when I have more time!
```

## Part 2 Q3: For the 10 compounds that target EGFR, which of them has (on average) the lowest AUC values in the breast cancer cell lines?

```{r Q3: Which of the 10 compounds targetting EGFR has the lowest average AUC values in the breast cancer cell lines?, echo = TRUE}
EGFR_lowest <- CTRP_total %>%
  select(area_under_curve, cancer_type, cpd_name, gene_symbol_of_protein_target) %>%
  filter(cancer_type == "breast") %>%
  filter(str_detect(gene_symbol_of_protein_target, "EGFR")) %>%
  arrange(area_under_curve)

EGFR_lowest %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(area_under_curve, cpd_name) +
  labs(title = "AUC values of compounds targeting EGFR in breast cancer cell lines", x = "Area under curve", y = "Compound name") +
  geom_boxplot()

### print(EGFR_lowest)
### Looks like afatinib has the lowest average AUC values in breast cancer cell lines. Neratinib has the absolute lowest AUC value, however.
