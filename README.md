Hello, I again went with the second option. This time, I was able to finish! Please let me know if I have gone about the process incorrectly anywhere, or if there is a simpler way to do things. A link to my work, for both parts 1 and 2, can be found [here](HW05_Parts1_&_2.md).

I did have a little trouble getting started on the first part, so I once again skimmed other submissions to get the hang of how some of the verbs affected the table. Eventually I was able to produce a table that fit the criteria and made sense to me.
