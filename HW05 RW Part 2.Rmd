##QUESTIONS

#Which cancer type has the lowest AUC values to the compound "vorinostat"?

vorinostat <- CTRP_Data_Full %>%
select (area_under_curve, cancer_type, cpd_name) %>%
filter(cpd_name == "vorinostat")

ggplot(vorinostat, aes( x = cancer_type, y = area_under_curve)) +
geom_boxplot()


#ANSWER: autonomic ganglia?


#Which compound is the prostate cancer cell line 22RV1 most sensitive to? (For 22RV1, which compound has the lowest AUC value?)

22RV1 <- CTRP_Data_Full %>%
select (cpd_name, area_under_curve, ccl_name) %>%
filter(ccl_name == "22RV1") %>%
arrange(area_under_curve)

#I'm getting an error from just this code above, not sure what's wrong?

#For the 10 compounds that target EGFR, which of them has (on average) the lowest AUC values in the breast cancer cell lines?

EGFR <- CTRP_Data_Full %>%
select( cpd_name, area_under_curve, gene_symbol_of_protein_target, cancer_type) %>%
filter (gene_symbol_of_protein_target == "EGFR") %>%
filter (cancer_type == "breast") %>%

ggplot(EGFR, aes(x = cpd_name, y = area_under_curve))

#I'm confused as to how to incorporate the average AUC here?
